<h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I have studied <b>Business Information Technology</b> at HÃ¤me University of Applied Sciences. At the moment I am
        looking for an internship either in software/web development or testing, but I wouldn't say no to an opening in 
        IT Support, either. I certainly have customer service experience for that, too.
