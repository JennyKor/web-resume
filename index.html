    <h1>Resume | Jenny Korkeamäki</h1>
    <p>
        This page is currently being build. I have a pretty clear plan I have sketched out on Figma, and I'm pretty sure I am able
        to execute it. There's also going to be a button to toggle between two styles, just to have some functionality instead of just
        a static page, either implemented with React or plain JavaScript. We'll see which one suits my needs as I advance on a Udemy
        Web Development Course.
